Project initialized with Angular following the [TypeScript kickstarter](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html).  If you wish to use this repo and *not* use TypeScript, you'll have to modify the /app component as well as modify the .gitignore to not omit JS files.  Check out the [JS kickstarter](https://angular.io/docs/js/latest/quickstart.html).  If you want to use Dart, you're weird.

### Task: Implement a tour of heros board using Angular 2.

# TypeScript
